#Project Name: Google Keep(Clone)

#Project_Details :

This is my third project in react Eco System. In this project, I tried to clone google keep with react-redux.

In this project I focused on Design, Sidenav & Redux.

#Main focus on:

1)Managing states with Redux. (Used redux were needed, where states need to drill only 1step, I used useState hooks there)

2)Managing states more efficiently.

3)Cloning Design in React

4)SideNav & Routing.

5)React-Redux Hooks(useSelector, useDispatch)

#Challenges I faced in this project:

This is my first Clone Project with React Ecosystem. I faced a lot of difficulties in this project. 1st difficulty was creating SideNav & Active SideNav. then a silly difficulty with react-router-dom. it took 2days to solve the routing problem. Then I faced difficulty with redux. I understood the workflow of redux, I understood how action creator, payload works. bt faced difficulties with dispatching & Reducer.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
