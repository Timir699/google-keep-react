#Project Name: Google Keep(Clone)

#Project_Details :

This is my third project in react Eco System. In this project, I tried to clone google keep with react-redux.

In this project I focused on Design, Sidenav & Redux.

#Main focus on:

1)Managing states with Redux. (Used redux were needed, where states need to drill only 1step, I used useState hooks there)

2)Managing states more efficiently.

3)Cloning Design in React

4)SideNav & Routing.

5)React-Redux Hooks(useSelector, useDispatch)

#Challenges I faced in this project:

This is my first Clone Project with React Ecosystem. I faced a lot of difficulties in this project. 1st difficulty was creating SideNav & Active SideNav. then a silly difficulty with react-router-dom. it took 2days to solve the routing problem. Then I faced difficulty with redux. I understood the workflow of redux, I understood how action creator, payload works. bt faced difficulties with dispatching & Reducer.
